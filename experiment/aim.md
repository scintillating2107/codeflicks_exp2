### Aim of the experiment
To Determine Friction Losses in a Straight Pipe-

  ~To measure the pressure drop along a known length of a straight, circular pipe through which fluid flows under steady conditions.

  ~To calculate the head loss due to friction using experimental data and compare it with theoretical predictions.

  ~To apply and verify the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which relates head loss to pipe length, diameter, flow velocity, and friction factor.

  ~To determine the friction factor for different flow rates and evaluate how it changes with the flow regime (laminar or turbulent).

  ~To calculate the Reynolds number for each trial and identify the nature of the flow (laminar, transitional, or turbulent).

  ~To investigate how friction losses vary with changes in:

  ~Flow velocity

  ~Pipe diameter

  ~Pipe roughness
 
  ~Fluid properties

  ~To enhance practical skills in using fluid mechanics lab instruments such as manometers, pressure gauges, flow meters, and stopwatches.

  ~To develop a deeper understanding of fluid flow behavior in pipelines and how friction affects the efficiency of fluid transport systems.
