<h2>Aim of the Experiment</h2>
<p>
  To determine the frictional losses occurring in a straight pipe due to the flow of fluid by measuring the pressure drop between two points along the pipe. 
  This experiment aims to analyze how friction loss varies with flow velocity and pipe characteristics, and to verify theoretical models such as the Darcy-Weisbach equation 
  by comparing experimental data with calculated values. The results help in understanding energy losses in pipe flow, which are critical in designing efficient fluid transport systems.
