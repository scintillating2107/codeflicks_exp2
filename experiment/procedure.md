### 🔍 Detailed Procedure:

Step 1: Initial Setup
    Ensure the apparatus is properly assembled.

    Fill the sump tank with clean water.

    Check for any leakage in the pipe or joints.

    Open the air vent of the manometer (if present) to remove trapped air.

Step 2: Start the Flow
    Start the water supply using a centrifugal pump.

    Gradually open the control valve to allow water to flow through the straight pipe.

    Allow some time for the system to stabilize and for steady flow to be established.

Step 3: Measure Pressure Drop
    Note the pressure heads at two points along the pipe using a U-tube manometer or pressure sensors.

    Record the difference in head between these two points — this represents the head loss due to friction.

Step 4: Measure Flow Rate
    Divert the water flowing from the pipe into a measuring tank or collecting vessel.

    Use a stopwatch to measure the time taken to collect a known volume of water.

    Calculate flow rate using:

    𝑄 = 𝑉/𝑡
​
 
  Where 
    Q = discharge (m³/s), 

    V = volume of water (m³),
  
    t = time (s).

Step 5: Calculate Velocity
    Use the formula:

𝑉 = 𝑄/𝐴


  Where 

𝐴 = 𝜋
𝐷^2
/4
​
    is the cross-sectional area of the pipe.

Step 6: Calculate Frictional Head Loss
  
  
    Using the observed pressure difference and known values of length, diameter, and velocity, calculate the head loss and compare it with 
  the theoretical value from Darcy–Weisbach equation.

Step 7: Repeat for Different Flow Rates
  
  
    Adjust the flow control valve to vary the discharge.

    Repeat the measurement steps for at least 3–5 different flow rates.

    Record all readings in a tabular format.
