  When fluid flows through a pipe, it experiences resistance due to the friction between the fluid layers and the pipe's internal surface. This resistance causes a loss of pressure or head, commonly known as <strong>friction loss</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The total energy of the fluid in the pipe is governed by the <em>Bernoulli's equation</em>, which assumes ideal, frictionless flow. However, in practical situations, energy is dissipated due to friction, and this must be accounted for by including a head loss term.
</p>

<p>
  The friction loss in a straight pipe is influenced by several factors, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Velocity of the fluid</li>
    <li>Diameter of the pipe</li>
    <li>Length of the pipe</li>
    <li>Roughness of the internal pipe surface</li>
    <li>Viscosity and density of the fluid</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  The head loss due to friction (h<sub>f</sub>) in a pipe can be estimated using the <strong>Darcy-Weisbach equation</strong>:
</p>

<p>
  Where:<br />
  <ul>
    <li><strong>h<sub>f</sub></strong> = head loss due to friction (m)</li>
    <li><strong>f</strong> = Darcy friction factor (dimensionless)</li>
    <li><strong>L</strong> = length of the pipe (m)</li>
    <li><strong>D</strong> = diameter of the pipe (m)</li>
    <li><strong>V</strong> = average velocity of the fluid (m/s)</li>
    <li><strong>g</strong> = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  The friction factor <strong>f</strong> depends on the flow regime:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Laminar flow</strong> (Reynolds number Re < 2000): The friction factor can be calculated using
      <br />f = 64 / Re
    </li>
    <li><strong>Turbulent flow</strong> (Re > 4000): The friction factor depends on pipe roughness and Reynolds number, often found using the Moody chart or empirical correlations such as the Colebrook equation.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity used to predict flow patterns in the pipe:
</p>

<p>
  Where:<br />
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ρ</strong> = density of the fluid (kg/m³)</li>
    <li><strong>μ</strong> = dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s)</li>
    <li><strong>ν</strong> = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m²/s)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  By measuring the pressure difference between two points along the pipe and the flow velocity, we can calculate the frictional head loss and analyze the energy losses due to friction. This helps in understanding the efficiency of fluid transport and is crucial in the design of piping systems in engineering applications.
