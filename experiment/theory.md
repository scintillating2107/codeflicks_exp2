📚 Theory (Simplified):


    When fluid flows through a pipe, it experiences frictional resistance due to the pipe's internal surface and the fluid's viscosity. 
  
    This causes a loss of pressure or energy, known as frictional head loss.

    The Darcy-Weisbach equation is used to calculate this loss:

    Hf = f. D/L. v^2/2g
​
    Where:

    hf : frictional head loss (m)

    f: Darcy friction factor

    L: length of pipe (m)

    D: pipe diameter (m)

    v: flow velocity (m/s)

    g: gravity (9.81 m/s²)

🌀 Flow Velocity:

  
    Velocity is found using the flow rate;
                                                   v = Q / A
 
🧮 Friction Factor (f):
    For laminar flow (Re < 2000):

                                                  𝑓 = 64/𝑅𝑒
​ 
    For turbulent flow (Re > 4000):
    Use Moody chart or empirical formulas.


✅ Purpose:
    Measure pressure drop along the pipe

    Calculate frictional head loss

    Compare experimental and theoretical results

    Understand flow characteristics (laminar/turbulent)
