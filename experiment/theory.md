<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Set up the experimental apparatus by connecting a straight pipe section to the fluid supply system, ensuring all joints are tight and leak-proof.</li>
  <li>Attach pressure measuring devices such as manometers or pressure gauges at two points along the pipe, separated by a known distance.</li>
  <li>Fill the system with the fluid (usually water) and ensure there are no air bubbles inside the pipe and pressure lines.</li>
  <li>Start the fluid flow through the pipe by turning on the pump or opening the inlet valve.</li>
  <li>Adjust the flow rate to a low, steady value using control valves or flow regulators.</li>
  <li>Record the pressure readings from the two measuring points once the flow stabilizes.</li>
  <li>Measure the volumetric flow rate by using a flow meter or by collecting the fluid discharged from the outlet over a measured time interval.</li>
  <li>Gradually increase the flow rate in steps, repeating steps 6 and 7 for each flow rate.</li>
  <li>Calculate the pressure drop (Î”P) between the two measuring points for each flow rate.</li>
  <li>Use the pressure drop and flow velocity data to calculate the frictional head loss in the pipe.</li>
  <li>Plot the pressure drop or frictional loss against flow velocity to analyze the relationship and compare with theoretical predictions (e.g., using Darcy-Weisbach equation).</li>
  <li>After completing the tests, slowly reduce the flow rate to zero, turn off the pump, and drain the system if necessary.</li>
  <li>Clean the equipment and check for any leaks or damage for future use.</li>
</ol>
