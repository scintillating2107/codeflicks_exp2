      "question": "Why is it important to measure friction losses in a straight pipe?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To determine the chemical properties of the fluid",
        "b": "To design efficient piping systems with minimum energy loss",
        "c": "To calculate the heat generated by the fluid",
        "d": "To study capillary action"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Chemical properties are unrelated to friction loss.",
        "b": "Correct! Measuring friction loss helps optimize energy use in pipe systems.",
        "c": "Heat generation is not the primary concern here.",
        "d": "Capillary action occurs in narrow tubes, not in general pipe flow."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Longer pipes create more frictional resistance.",
        "b": "Velocity is directly proportional to friction loss in turbulent flow.",
        "c": "Correct! Fluid color has no effect on friction loss.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Pascal is a unit of pressure, not head loss.",
        "b": "Correct! Head loss is expressed in meters (of fluid column).",

      "question": "In turbulent flow, how does frictional loss typically vary with velocity?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Linearly with velocity",
        "b": "Inversely with velocity",
        "c": "Proportional to velocity squared",
        "d": "Independent of velocity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is true for laminar flow, not turbulent.",
        "b": "Incorrect, friction increases with velocity.",
        "c": "Correct! In turbulent flow, head loss is roughly proportional to the square of velocity.",
        "d": "Friction loss always depends on velocity."
