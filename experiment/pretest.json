      "question": "What does frictional loss in a pipe primarily depend on?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Type of fluid only",
        "b": "Length and roughness of the pipe",
        "c": "Color of the pipe",
        "d": "Direction of sunlight"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Fluid type matters, but pipe length and roughness are more critical.",
        "b": "Correct! These physical properties directly influence friction losses.",
        "c": "Color has no impact on fluid dynamics.",
        "d": "Sunlight does not affect internal pipe friction."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following flow regimes is most associated with significant friction losses?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Static fluid",
        "b": "Laminar flow",
        "c": "Turbulent flow",
        "d": "Supersonic flow"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A static fluid does not flow and hence has no friction loss.",
        "b": "Laminar flow has lower friction losses compared to turbulent.",
        "c": "Correct! Turbulent flow results in higher friction losses.",
        "d": "Supersonic flow is not typically studied in simple pipe flow scenarios."

    {
      "question": "What does the Reynolds number indicate in pipe flow?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The chemical composition of the fluid",
        "b": "The speed of sound in the fluid",
        "c": "Whether the flow is laminar or turbulent",
        "d": "The temperature gradient in the pipe"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Reynolds number does not describe chemical composition.",
        "b": "It’s unrelated to acoustic properties.",
        "c": "Correct! It predicts the flow regime.",
        "d": "It’s not a thermal parameter."

    {
      "question": "If the flow rate increases in a pipe, what generally happens to the friction loss?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It decreases",
        "b": "It remains constant",
        "c": "It increases",
        "d": "It becomes zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "More flow causes more energy loss due to friction.",
        "b": "Friction loss varies with flow conditions.",
        "c": "Correct! More flow leads to greater losses.",
        "d": "Friction loss never becomes zero during flow."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the head loss in a straight pipe due to friction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A gain in mechanical energy",
        "b": "A pressure drop along the length of the pipe",
        "c": "A thermal reaction inside the fluid",
        "d": "An increase in pipe diameter"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Friction causes energy loss, not gain.",
        "b": "Correct! Friction leads to a pressure drop, called head loss.",
        "c": "No significant thermal reaction is involved.",
        "d": "Pipe diameter may influence friction but is not the result of it."
