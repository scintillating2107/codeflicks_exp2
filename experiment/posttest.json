      "question": "What is the primary cause of friction loss in a straight pipe?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Change in pipe direction",
        "b": "Pipe expansion",
        "c": "Resistance due to viscosity of fluid and pipe wall roughness",
        "d": "Fluid evaporation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This typically causes minor losses, not friction losses.",
        "b": "Expansion causes local head losses, not frictional ones.",
        "c": "Correct. Friction loss is due to interaction between fluid viscosity and pipe roughness.",
        "d": "Evaporation is not a factor in friction loss."

      "question": "Which equation is used to calculate head loss due to friction in a straight pipe?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Bernoulli's Equation",
        "b": "Darcy-Weisbach Equation",
        "c": "Reynolds Number Equation",
        "d": "Pascalâ€™s Law"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Bernoulli's Equation is for energy conservation, not friction loss.",
        "b": "Correct. It specifically calculates frictional head loss.",
        "c": "This is used to determine flow regime, not friction loss.",
        "d": "This relates to pressure transmission, not flow resistance."

      "question": "In the Darcy-Weisbach equation, what does the symbol 'f' represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Flow rate",
        "b": "Friction factor",
        "c": "Force applied",
        "d": "Frequency of flow"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Flow rate is represented by Q, not f.",
        "b": "Correct. 'f' is the dimensionless friction factor.",
        "c": "Force is not represented by 'f' here.",
        "d": "Frequency is unrelated to pipe flow friction."

        "c": "Fluid viscosity",
        "d": "Pipe color"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Longer pipes cause more friction loss.",
        "b": "Smaller diameters increase friction.",
        "c": "Higher viscosity increases resistance.",
        "d": "Correct. Color has no impact on friction."

      "question": "As the flow rate of fluid increases in a pipe, the friction loss generally:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreases linearly",
        "b": "Stays constant",
        "c": "Increases",
        "d": "Becomes zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Friction loss increases, not decreases.",
        "b": "It depends on velocity and flow regime.",
        "c": "Correct. Friction loss increases with velocity.",
        "d": "Friction never becomes zero in real systems."
