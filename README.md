<b> Experiment|     <b> To Find The Friction losses in a straight pipe 

### About the Experiment 

In fluid flow through a pipe, friction losses are the result of the resistance offered by the internal surface of the pipe and the viscosity of the fluid. When a fluid (like water) flows through a pipe, energy is lost due to the interaction between the fluid layers and between the fluid and the pipe walls. This energy loss is known as the frictional head loss or major head loss.

The main aim of this experiment is to quantify the head loss due to friction along a straight pipe and validate it using theoretical formulas like the Darcy-Weisbach equation.
